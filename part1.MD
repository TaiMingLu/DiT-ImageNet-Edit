## Warmup project, part 1: Background

You may skip this phase if you feel you are well-prepared, but be aware that later on we might ask you about the key concepts and background to ensure you're aligned with the foundations.

### **Purpose of the Seed Phase**

The Seed Phase is meant to help you build a solid foundation on relevant topics in the group by carefully reading a curated set of important papers. The goal is to develop your own understanding of the core ideas, methods, motivations, and historical developments on AI research. This phase is not about memorizing details or reproducing derivations; it is about building familiarity with the ideas, learn about research methods, and forming thoughtful judgments based on your own reading.

### **Overall Expectations**

* You will receive a spreadsheet containing **30 papers**.
* Select **15 papers** from that list and read through all of them during the Seed Phase.
* A reasonable pace is **5 papers per week**, and you can read more if you prefer.
* Focus on understanding:

  * what problem each paper is addressing,
  * the central idea or approach,
  * why the method works at a conceptual level,
  * and what you think the main takeaways are.
* Do not use GPT or any LLM tool to summarize, read, or process the papers. The purpose of this phase is to strengthen your own reading and reasoning, and relying on AI-generated summaries defeats that intention.
* You may keep your own notes, mark confusions, or track connections between papers—this is optional and for your personal benefit.

### **Weekly Report Requirement**

Each week, send one report to r01566525@gmail.com describing what you read, what you understood from the papers, what ideas or insights stood out to you, and any questions or unclear points you want to return to next week.
