## Warmup project, part 1: Background

_You may skip this phase if you feel you are well-prepared, but be aware that later on we might ask you about the key concepts and background to ensure you're aligned with the foundations._

The Background Phase is meant to help you build a solid foundation on relevant topics in the group by carefully reading a curated set of important papers. The goal is to develop your own understanding of the core ideas, methods, motivations, and recent developments in AI research.

### **Overall Expectations**

* You will receive a spreadsheet containing **30 papers**.
* Select **15 papers** from that list of your interest and read through all of them during the Background Phase.
* A reasonable pace is **1 papers per week**, and you can read more if you prefer.
* Focus on understanding:

  * what problem each paper is addressing,
  * the central idea or approach,
  * why the method works at a conceptual level,
  * and what you think the main takeaways are.
* You should read it thoroughly yourself. You can use LLM to help you understand the papers and its related works.

### **Weekly Report Requirement**

Each week, send one report to r01566525@gmail.com describing what you read, what you understood from the papers, what ideas or insights stood out to you, and any questions or unclear points you want to return to next week. The reports need to be written by you, not an LLM.
